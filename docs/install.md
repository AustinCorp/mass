# Installation
## 1) Install the program
For now, the installation method is ./install.sh. I suggest giving it a read to see what it does. I've detailed the different ways of using it below.

### Types of install
#### As root (System-wide)
If you run `./install` as root, mass will be installed to be available system wide.

#### Linked (Development)
If you run `./install linked` as a non-root user, mass will be linked to original the files that it was installed from. This is particularly useful for development. 

##### As yourself (Local)
If you run `./install` as a non-root user, mass will only be available to that user. Realistically I think the only time you'll use this now is experimentation or trying to reproduce a bug.

## 2) Link the modules you want
At this point you probably want all of them execpt example.php.

## 3) Getting data to use
