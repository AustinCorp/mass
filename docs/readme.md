Welcome to the documentation. I hope you'll find it friendly and useful.

On a day-to-day basis `mass --help=searchTerm` should be your first point of call since that will always be the most up-to-date as it is syntactically required to create a feature. However the docs found here and within the [packages](../packages-available) (such as [AWS](../packages-available/AWS/docs)) should give your a bigger picture view.

If you're starting out, you'll want [install.md](install.md) to get you up and running with data. (Even if you have it installed, you should take a look at this!) After that [gettingStarted.md](gettingStarted.md) will give you a very basic jumpstart into using mass.

Once you're ready to do custom stuff, you'll want to check out the "creatingA" series. I recommend starting with [creatingAPackage.md](creatingAPackage.md), which will save you much effort! And then move on to [creatingAMacro.md](creatingAMacro.md) and [creatingATemplate.md](creatingATemplate.md).


If you spot a _TODO_ in the documentation, you're welcome to fill it in. That would be very helpful!
