# Description
#   Lists out enabled packages in a profile.
#
# Syntax:
#   $0 profileName [--short]
#     profileName is a named profile. # TODO Think up a better description when I don't have a couple arguing beside me.
#
# Examples:
#   Lists the profiles including any symlink infomation.
#   $0
#   Lists the current repos without symlink information. This is what you will want if you want to write scripts using this script.
#   $0 --short
