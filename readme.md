# Mass
is a modularised script for managing several nodes of a cluster. Open individual SSH terminals to specific groups of nodes of your cluster, a single node, or the whole lot. Do the same with CSSH or virtual terminals in screen. Upload a file to each node or dowload a file from each, prefixed with the hostname. Run a command to conquer the world... or conduct that essential maintenance. Essentially your nodes are one RegEx away.

# Requirements
* PHP
* Bash

# Install
See docs/install.md
Use install.sh.

# History
I've written a version of this script at every company I've worked at since 2007 and it's always been a big hit. In each case it was very specific to the architecture of the given place, so it wasn't very portable.

Yet again the scenario came up where it would be useful, so this time I've developed it entirely in my own time, which means I can take the time to do it right. Now it's at a point that it will be useful at work and I'm ready to release it. I'm not including any company specific information/data in the project (that would be silly!), so it probably won't be useful to other people for a few more weeks. By then I intend to have tools which generate that data.
